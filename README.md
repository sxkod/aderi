An Associated Data Editor for Reference Images

OK, I made that up.
Basically a simple editor that allows you to see images in a folder as icons.
You can select one image at a time and add scribbles, text etc when working on a creative idea.
The lines and text are stored in a hidden folder in the same directory and loaded when the images are reopened in aderi.
Original images are not modified.
You can export the modified versions of images as well.

Have fun
